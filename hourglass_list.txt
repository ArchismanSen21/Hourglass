First loop is :
for(int i=0;i<6;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<6;j++)
            {
                .....
            }
        }
It is use for inputting user's elements in the matrix.
Its time complexity is : O(n^2)

Secound loop is :
for(int i=0;i<4;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<4;j++)
            {
                .....
            }
        }
It is use to find the sum of hour glass thought it runs from index 0 to 3 it has two loops so its time complexity is same as the first loop.
Total time complexity is : 
->O(n^2)+O(n^2)
->2O(n^2)
->O(n^2)

The time complexity is in polynomial fuction "n^2" so it will increase as more the size of i and j increases.
